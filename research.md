# Sand tests
run-time tests with some plastic-funnels

to stop the time i have used [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/s_light/6eraws0m/show)
(use the space-bar to start&stop and `x` to reset)

| sample | volume | big | medium | small | extra small* |
| :----: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :---: | :---------: |
| A      |  100ml | 4s   | 11s | 19s | 21s |
| A      |  200ml | 7s   | 20s | 42s | 36s |
| A      |  200ml | 10s  | 29s | 59s | 49s |
| B      |  200ml | 8s   | 23s | 45s | 40s |

\*extra small funnel size - but the end-diameter seems to be eagle to the 'small' one.
both have about ⌀6mm

i also tested with a handmade paper funnel -
the opening was about ~1x8mm
with 50ml sand it needed about 3minutes

# conclusion
we need some very fine sand or glass balls -
i think <= ⌀0,5mm
so for sand that means screening...

# Glass balls
